//const myName: string = 'Sergio'

//: string is the TYPE ANNOTATION, there are many types:

/*
string / number / boolean / undefined / null / any (basic ones)
*/

/*let myName = 'Stephen'

myName = 10*/

//this case is TYPE INFERENCE, even if its a let in normal js, its already initialized as a string, cannot change to number
//if it was undeclared, it would be default type any
